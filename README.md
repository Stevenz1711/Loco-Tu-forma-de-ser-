# Ser — Loco por tu forma de ser

This is a small web page that shows animated lyrics inside heart-shaped speech bubbles (blue & white theme). It's made to be a sweet dedication.

Files:
- `index.html` — the main page (open in browser)
- `serve.py` — tiny Python helper to serve the folder locally

How to run locally (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
# Start local server
python serve.py
# Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

How to publish on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Push the files (`index.html`, `serve.py`, `README.md`) to the repo.
3. In the repository settings enable GitHub Pages from the `main` branch (root).
4. After a minute the page will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.
